# RAG agent with in-the-loop evals

This repo is a very basic example of using in-the-loop evals to improve your LangGraph applications.

## Configuration

The configuration for this graph takes two keys:
- `model` -> either 'mini' (gpt-4o-mini) or '4o' (gpt-4o)
- `do_evals` -> either `True` or `False`, indicates whether to do in the loop evals
